# Apollo ðŸ’Ž
### The first search engine where you choose what content to put in

Apollo is a different type of search engine. Traditional search engines (like Google) are great for **discovery** when you're trying to find the answer to a question, but you don't know what you're looking for.

However, they're very poor at **recall** when you've seen something before on the internet somewhere but can't remember where. Trying to find it becomes a nightmare - I've wasted many an hour combing through Google and my search history to look up a good article, blog post, or just something I've seen before.

Even with built in systems to store some of my favorite [articles](https://zeus.amirbolous.com/articles), [podcasts](https://zeus.amirbolous.com/podcasts), and other stuff, I forget things **all the time**.

## Thesis
Screw finding a needle in the haystack. Let's create a new type of search to **choose which gem you're loking for**

Apollo is a search engine to digest **your digital footprint**. What this means is that **you choose what to put in it**. When you come across something that looks interesting, be it an article, blog post, website, whatever, you **manually add it** (with built in systems to make doing so easy). This tackles one of the biggest problems of recall in search engines returning a lot of irrelevant information because with Apollo, **the signal to noise ratio is very high**. You've chosen **exactly what to put in it**.

Apollo is not necessarly built for raw discovery (although it certainly matches rediscovery), it's built for knowledge compression and transformation - that is looking up things that you've previously deemed to be cool


### Workflows
1. If it's an article, need to paste the body of the article
2. If it's a podcast episode, transcribe it with [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/) then put it in
